QuickOwnerChange - change the ticket owner quickly

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With this addon you get a dropdown in the ticket zoom and ticket overview that
makes it possible to change the owner with two clicks...

It conflicts with original QuickOwnerChange - as this one provides menus via different files and requires some changes to otrs native files.
